          <p>I booked a tour with Lebanonaholic during my trip to Beirut, and I must say I was thoroughly impressed. From start to finish, everything was exceptionally well-organized and executed. The tour guide was knowledgeable, professional, and friendly, and she went to ensure that I had a fantastic experience. The itinerary was well-crafted and included many hidden gems that I would have otherwise missed out on. The transportation was comfortable, and the logistics were seamless, making my trip stress-free and enjoyable. The guide's flexibility in accommodating my interests and preferences was much appreciated, and her recommendations for restaurants and local delicacies were spot on. I highly recommend Lebanonaholic to anyone seeking a top-notch tour experience in Beirut. They exceeded my expectations and made my visit to Lebanon genuinely unforgettable.</p>

We fell in love with Jeita Grotto and Harissa and Rouba quickly won our hearts! She shared so much information with us, was open to lots of questions and took us amazing pictures! Without her, our stay in Lebanon wouldn't be the same. We made great memories! Thank you, Rouba!</p>
